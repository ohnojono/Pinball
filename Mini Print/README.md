Project files specific to the Mini Print project

About
-----
The annual mini print exhibition by MA Print students and staff.

**Format:** 20 x 25 cm paper, and a maximum image size 10 x 8cm 
**Edition:** 60 

Arnolini Bookshop, Bristol
**Preview:** Thursday 3 December, 2015 (5.00 - 7.30pm)

In return for participation, each artist recieves a full set of 30 prints. 5 of the remaining prints from each edition are archived in the CFPR and UWE collections, and the rest are available to buy.

Concept
-------
The subject and medium for each print is dictated by the individual artist

For my print I plan to produce something which relates to the theme of my final project, but also acts as a testing gound for the direction of my work, particularly in terms of execution and style.

Conceptually I am exploring the relationship between digital and physical objects using the theme of games and play - specifically pinball. 

This project will be a chance to execute ideas of skecthing digitally in 3D software and how that object translates to print (or physically in some way)

Progress
-------

#### Proof of concept
I've expored this idea of drawing 3D and translating to print. 
**Examples:**
[Visual Thought](http://jonosandilands.blogspot.co.uk/2015/03/visual-thought.html)
[Particle Memory](http://jonosandilands.blogspot.co.uk/2015/04/particle-thought.html)

I want to expand and refine this. Part of that is to become better at using 3D software. I've decided to focus on using Blender as it is open source and I am finding it easier to work with than Rhino.

#### Experimentation (17 September 2015)
I'm going to start producing a series of test pieces to explore using 3D software as a sketchbook and outputting up to the stage of ready to print files.

I will list these below, and save all seperate experimentation's working files into sub directories

## **001** - 17/9/15
- [Mockup](Experiments/001/MP_experiment_001.png)
- [Blender File](Experiments/001/001.blend)

Notes: Practice creating basic 3D geometry in Blender, testing workflow for exporting the image and processing with diffusion dither for screenprint. 

Trying out a layer of colour but not happy with the murkiness - need to retain (or try to recreate) the vivid RGB colours - few ideas to try (change key colour, and export the colour layers flat). 

Techincal note: because I am creating these for the intention of screenprinting I want to find a workflow I can generate the seperate layers of colour *almost* directly from Blender.

Workflow: 
- **Key Layer** Material white / **Blender** render image / **Photoshop** Diffusion Dither
- **Colour Layer** Material coloured default / **Blender** render image / **Photoshop** Diffusion Dither


## **002** - 18/9/15

- [Mockup - Black key colour](Experiments/002/MP_experiment_002.jpg)
- [Mockup - Purple key colour](Experiments/002/MP_experiment_002-variation.jpg)
- [Blender File](Experiments/002/002.blend)

Imporving the vividness of the representation of colour. 2 versions trying out the two ideas I had from 001 - to export the colour layers flat (with no shading) and change the key colour from black to (in this case) purple. Much happier with these results.

Workflow: 
- **Key Layer** Material white + increased intensity / **Blender** render image / **Photoshop** Diffusion Dither
- **Colour Layer** Material coloured shadeless / **Blender** render image / **Photoshop** Flat artwork as exported

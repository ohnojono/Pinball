About
-----
The annual mini print exhibition by MA Print students and staff.

**Format:** 20 x 25 cm paper, and a maximum image size 10 x 8cm 
**Edition:** 60 

Arnolini Bookshop, Bristol
**Preview:** Thursday 3 December, 2015 (5.00 - 7.30pm)

In return for participation, each artist recieves a full set of 30 prints. 5 of the remaining prints from each edition are archived in the CFPR and UWE collections, and the rest are available to buy.

Concept
-------
The subject and medium for each print is dictated by the individual artist

For my print I plan to produce something which relates to the theme of my final project, but also acts as a testing gound for the direction of my work, particularly in terms of execution and style.

Conceptually I am exploring the relationship between digital and physical objects using the theme of games and play - specifically pinball. 

This project will be a chance to execute ideas of skecthing digitally in 3D software and how that object translates to print (or physically in some way)

Progress
-------

###### Proof of concept
I've expored this idea of drawing 3D and translating to print. 
**Examples:**
[Visual Thought](http://jonosandilands.blogspot.co.uk/2015/03/visual-thought.html)
[Particle Memory](http://jonosandilands.blogspot.co.uk/2015/04/particle-thought.html)

I want to expand and refine this. Part of that is to become better at using 3D software. I've decided to focus on using Blender as it is open source and I am finding it easier to work with than Rhino.

###### Experimentation (17 September 2015)
I'm going to start producing a series of test pieces to explore using 3D software as a sketchbook and outputting up to the stage of ready to print files.

I will list these below, and save all seperate experimentation's working files into sub directories
